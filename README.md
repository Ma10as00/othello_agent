# Othello Agent
Reinforcement learning model for Othello

Welcome to our (Mathias Ã˜gaard \& Tobias Verheijen) project repository for the course _Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making Under Uncertainty_ in the Spring Semester of 2024 for the JMCS program.
Within our repository you will find a number of useful items:
- Our project's final report (Reinforcement Leanring - Final Report)
- All files relating to the Environment used to train our models (Environment)
- A folder containing a few training options if you want to train your own agent using our pipeline (Training_files)
- And lastly, the file 'play_reversi_othello.py', a script wherein the user can play against any of the agents mentioned in our Final Report. When running this script, you will first be prompted to select your AI agent, then you might be asked to specify the depth of the AI agent depending on your selection, lastly you will select whether or not you want to play first. The game then begins! You will now insert your game move in the console, please type your inputs as _Row_ _Col_, simply with a space between your desired placement and press enter. If you want to quit the program, simply press enter when it's your turn, or enter 'q'.

Thanks for reading, enjoy!
Best wishes,
Mathias \& Tobias
